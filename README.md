# Weather-Application With REAL-TIME API

Hello, I'm Jagrit, and I'm excited to present my project. My primary goal with this project is to create a responsive and dynamic weather application website featuring a real-time API. Users can simply input a city name, and in return, they will receive the current weather along with date and time information.

Here's the tech stack I employed for this project:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, Real-time API integration, Node.js, Express.js

-->The project consists of the following key sections:

  1.) Home: The landing page of the website.
  2.) Weather: This section allows users to search for weather information by typing in a city name.
  3.) About: Here, you can find information about the project and its creator.
  4.) 404 Error Page: In case a user requests a page that doesn't exist, a custom 404 error page has been included to provide a better user experience.


Feel free to explore the website and experience real-time weather updates for any city of your choice.
